# Brief Discription 
### What is this repository?
This is the repository for Assignment B3 for STAT 545B. As part of this assignment, I chose to create a Shiny app (Option B). The app created can be used to input your preferences and determine which Starbucks drink choices are available to you according to those preferences!
